## About Me
I enjoy backend development in .Net and building graphics projects from scratch.<br>
I mainly use a MacBook with VS Code but also work with Linux servers and AWS for cloud projects.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Here *below* are some old projects I found while going through my files. Most of them are about graphics because showing server-side stuff is harder. *The code is rough and not polished*, but I thought they might be *fun to share* (some of them on Github).

### MMORPG
- **Server:** Multiple versions across .NET and in the past LuaJIT
- **Client:** Unity, Developer Client .NET + Raylib

### My First WPF Desktop App
⚠️ **Warning:** This project was my first WPF application, <u>created before 2019</u>. At the time, I found it pretty exciting. It includes a login system, several small apps, and games I quickly put together to learn. The screenshots were taken on a Mac using Wine. *I have no idea where the source code is now.*
- Included a calculator
- Featured stopwatches
- Had a pseudo "cookie clicker" game called Coin Master
- Included a simple AI chasing game

### Cosmic Gliders
This was a game idea I gave up on because I started working on something cooler ([Online MMORPG](#MMORPG)). It was a multiplayer game with an authoritative server written in LuaJIT, client was made in Unity.

### Submarine Test (On my PC named oceangate :D)
Created using the Love2D Framework
- Played with an Xbox controller for a natural experience
- Endless map with procedural generation
- Stones form interconnected caves
- Deeper levels have more stones, increasing difficulty

### Zombie Test
This project was unique as it was built without a game engine or framework. Features include buildings, sound zones, and line-of-sight mechanics.
