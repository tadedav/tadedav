> ## ⚠️ *Disclaimer!* ⚠️
> ### *If you're looking for some .Net/C# code (especially the way I code), the only public projects available are [TamarinDB](https://github.com/tadedav/TamarinDB), [TamarinDashboard](https://github.com/tadedav/TamarinDashboard) and [My First WPF Desktop App](#my-first-wpf-desktop-app). The reason is that .NET, for me, is more production-oriented, and I can't share much. ([TamarinDB](https://github.com/tadedav/TamarinDB) + [TamarinDashboard](https://github.com/tadedav/TamarinDashboard)) are the only public projects I'm currently working on (just a little), without any comments or polish because they were rushed.*

## About Me
I love backend development, especially with .NET and Luvit. I also enjoy exploring graphics engines and want to learn more about like C++ and Vulkan. AI and Virtual reality excites me too.

I mainly use a MacBook with VS Code but also work with Linux servers and AWS for cloud projects.
I currently have 2 PCs at home serving as local servers.

## Project Showcase
>### Here are some old projects I found while going through my files. Most of them are about graphics because showing server-side stuff is harder. The code is rough and not polished, but I thought they might be fun to share (some of them on Github).

### Cosmic Gliders
This was a game idea I gave up on because I started working on something cooler ([Online MMORPG](#MMORPG)). It was a multiplayer game with an authoritative server written in LuaJIT, client was made in Unity.

### Zombie Test
This project was unique as it was built without a game engine or framework. Features include buildings, sound zones, and line-of-sight mechanics.

### My First WPF Desktop App
⚠️ **Warning:** This project was my first WPF application, created before 2019. At the time, I found it pretty exciting. It includes a login system, several small apps, and games I quickly put together to learn. The screenshots were taken on a Mac using Wine. *I have no idea where the source code is now.*
- Included a calculator
- Featured stopwatches
- Had a pseudo "cookie clicker" game called Coin Master
- Included a simple AI chasing game
